I am Lorenzo Posti, a postdoctoral researcher in Astrophysics at the Observatory of Strasbourg (France). You can find my updated *list of publications* on [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/fCiUp3W_T7qXYNboezCKAg) and some info on my personal [website](http://astro.u-strasbg.fr/~posti/).
