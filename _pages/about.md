I am Lorenzo Posti, currently a postdoctoral researcher in Astrophysics at the Observatory of Strasbourg (France). Before that, I've been working on research in Astrophysics in
Groningen (Netherlands), Bologna (Italy), Oxford (UK) and Baltimore (USA).

You can find my updated *list of publications* on [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/fCiUp3W_T7qXYNboezCKAg). I used to maintain a personal website with some details
on my research, however I stopped doing that for various reasons. An archived and
stripped-down version can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210624122158/http://astro.u-strasbg.fr/~posti/).
