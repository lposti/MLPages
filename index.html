# An Astronomer's perspective on Deep Learning

This blog contains notes and notebooks of a professional Astronomer diving deep into the study
of deep learning. What I found during my quest, and what I report here, is meant to be purely
anecdotical and not necessarily following a logical and sound educational path. The
hope with which I build this blog is that it will eventually be useful to me to look back at
and that other people with a similar background may find some use out of these notes and
notebooks.

My name is Lorenzo Posti and I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the
[Strasbourg Observatory](https://astro.unistra.fr/) (France) specialized in models of galaxy
dynamics, which I use to study the origin of galaxies and the nature of dark matter.

This site is built using [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).
The diagram of the neural network in the banner was made using [NN-SVG](http://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/index.html),
the input image shows isophotal contours of the galaxy NGC 4342 rendered from
[Hubble observations](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/hst).
